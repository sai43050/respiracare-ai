### 1. Current Diagnostic Status
Patient **{patient_name}** shows multiple logged predictive modalities. While specific inference models detected anomalies related to viral pneumonia vectors, the localized aggregation suggests the patient is recovering. *(Mock Generated)*

### 2. Vital Sign Analysis
SpO2 remains largely stable, though erratic respiratory rates were logged during nighttime cycles. Heart rate fluctuates between normal clinical thresholds.

### 3. Recommended Actions
- Prescribe rest and elevate posture.
- Monitor cough severity over the next 48 hours.
- Repeat acoustic model sampling on Day 3.
